career-profile:
    title: Profile
    summary: |
          Being the Manager of people and providing Leadership is both a role and a responsibility which I take very seriously and find satisfaction within. I have coupled my knowledge within IT with a Masters degree in Leadership and Management to be able to provide the best possible platform for having an eye on the goals as well as the toolset for motivating people to get there. I am a highly adaptable human being who enjoys learning and gaining new experiences. Also a firm believer of Agile ways-of-working and have proven experience working with empirical approaches. I am motivated by seeing people succeed and enjoy coaching people in their professional journey. 

          My competencies range from the engineering disciplines to economics; from software development to people management - and I use these to ensure a work place where we reach our goals and thrive doing so. I am using these competencies to bridge the gaps in understanding between business and development on all levels. Thriving also means a focus on work/life-balance which is important to me as a Manager, but also to me as an individual. I insists on maintaining this balance as this allows me to be the best version of myself which reflects on my kids and my wife in my personal life.

          I am very capable of working on all layers within the Enterprise as well as understanding the needs of customers and users. I have throughout my career insisted on user involvement. Knowing that users enjoy working with the things I have participated in creating, is the ultimate driver for me.

          I am a person who is both curious and highly adaptable in regards to new challenges, changes and people, and I am able to bridge my knowledge of Technology in to meaningful communication in regards to ensuring the formulated goals within the domain of Digital Transformation.
